## Purpose

This is intended to be used as a standalone, centralised, offline POS software system. It is operating system agnostic thanks to the Election.js wrapper. It is made with web technologies so it is very quick and easy to make modifications to its functionality and layout.

It is made to be offline and system agnostic so that it can be used on any system available be completely secure and reliable.

It uses a simple and intuitive button bar layout at the bottom to easily manage billing, customers and tables with a touch screen.

### Challenges faced

It is not easy to adapt web technologies into a native desktop environment. Electron.js combined with SQLite is not easy to setup out of the box.

Data structures start to get more complex as the functionality started to expand.
